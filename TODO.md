##Development Problems##
- The ground of all abstract and independent libraries such as this is the problem
  to define such terms in the code.  e.g. Define a triangle, line, point.  Such
  grounds are required before any meddling with code with I have failed to do...
  Learning geometric rules and principles is first and foremost.

- The main vision for this project was to create simple graphics with high-level
  JavaScript functions.  I do not know yet what plug-in (library) I will use for
  that.  And I know that will affect this.

##This is a top-of-my-head list of contingent fixes & fulfillments.##
- Lots of testing.

- Use a plug-in library to create actual graphics, graphic format doesn ot matter.

- Add a wider range of high-level functions to the classes.  Yes, learn geometry.

- Focus on the best production directory/file structure.

- Reconsider:  do some of the geometry functions in utils.js not belong there.

- Reconsider:  in index.js, some (declared) functions are names exactly as a
   variable holding a different function.  The latter uses the former, but bad
   naming practice.

- Reconsider:  there is an innate debate and slightly present inconsistency
   about some functions that take in a class instance and others which are part
   of the function's prototype object.  Focus on one only.
